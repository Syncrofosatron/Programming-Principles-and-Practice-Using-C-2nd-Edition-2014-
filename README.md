# Programming-Principles-and-Practice-Using-C-2nd-Edition-2014-
Answers to the exercises given in the book Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ 2nd Edition (2014) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

Note:
Please don't just look at the exercises to solve the problem that you are facing, once you have tried enough and did what you could, refer to this only then, and it's better that way. :-)

Why is it?
I am trying to learn C++ from the beginning and Mr. Bjarne Stroustrup himself in a Udacity course suggested to read this book (Programming Principles and Practice Using C++) if you are a beginner/amateur and want to understand it. So here I am doing that and also trying to solve each and every question being given, even if it looks mundane.

What's coming?
I will be adding extensive comments in the programs that I have wrote and the further ones I would be writing, currently they are lacking as it takes time to write proper comments which are concise, but I know how important comments are for fellow programmer to understand so I find that I must do that soon enough.
